Notes to Tutorial REACT : 

1.  front-end JavaScript library for creating UI component-based user interfaces.
2. React for its simplicity, flexibility, performance, usability, virtual DOM, components, and many other features.
3. straightforward and modular infrastructure
4.React is a JavaScript framework, it is critical to understand certain JavaScript fundamentals in order to flow and understand React.
5. npm create-react-app - Xommand for creating ready to use React App

Structure of Application(Architecture):

6.node_modules folder - Dependencies
7.public folder - contains some static files, such as the HTML file
8.The only code to remember is the div with the id root where the entire React application will be placed.
9.src folder - is where development takes place
10.React elements are immutable.!

11. 
  App.js - all of your components   will eventually meet 

   index.js - where you target the root id from the index.html file and render the App.js file
  
    App.css and index.css - These both contain styles for your application.
12.JSX - JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together
13.create-react-app internally uses Babel for the JSX to JavaScript conversion

Example of Code in React with JSX: 
-const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>JSX Title</h1>
      <p>This is first JSX Element!</p>
      <p>This is another JSX Element</p>
    </div>
  );
};
